# Matt Benyon- Data science/analysis project portfolio

Here are a list of my recent projects:
# [1. NBA 2K player ratings analysis](https://github.com/MattBenyon/DataAnalysisPortfolio/tree/main/2Kratings)
- Acquiring the data: Scraped data from [2kratings.com](https://www.2kratings.com/), [basketballreference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/allstar/NBA_2021_voting.html)            and downloaded .csv file from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/). 
- Cleaning the data: Cleaned the data by renaming columns, dropping nan's, splitting strings so player names matched format across dataframes etc.
- Plotting the data: Used MatPlotLib to create plots of All-Star votes against NBA 2K ratings, FiveThirtyEights RAPTOR WAR metric against 2K ratings among others. Used Scipy package to fit a line to the appropriate figures. Provided a logarithmic version to show correlation.
- Project was completed at own leisure as a test of my developing scraping, cleaning and analysing skills. I wanted to test a hypothesis I had that NBA 2K player ratings were swayed more by popularity than by defensive impact. I verified this hypothesis but also acknowldged that a players popularity is mostly a product of their offensive ability. Overall I found that defensive impact had little correlation with a players rating and player popularity correlated strongly.

An example figure from the study:

Feel free to check out my write up available at the hyperlink on the heading or through my GitHub page.
> Write-up coming soon once completed undergraduate exams

# 2. Linear Regression of the basketball 'four factors' from previous seasons to predict a teams success in the current season, based on the same metrics
> Project completed but need to write up and summarise my findings, will complete after undergraduate exams
