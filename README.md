# Matt Benyon- Data science/analysis project portfolio

Here are a list of my recent projects:
1. NBA 2K ratings analysis
    - Acquiring the data: Scraped data from [2kratings.com](https://www.2kratings.com/), [basketballreference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/allstar/NBA_2021_voting.html)            and downloaded .csv file from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/). 
    - Cleaning the data: Cleaned the data by renaming columns, dropping nan's, splitting strings so player names matched format across dataframes etc.
    - Plotting the data: Used MatPlotLib to create plots of All-Star votes against NBA 2K ratings, FiveThirtyEights RAPTOR WAR metric against 2K ratings among others. Used Scipy package to fit a line to the appropriate figures. Provided a logarithmic version to show correlation.

2. Linear Regression of the basketball 'four factors' histrically to predict a teams success in the current season, based on the same metrics
    - NA
    - NA





An example of a figure from a recent study that I completed:
